# Artificial-Intelligence-Assignment

implemented a game of ‘Guess The Word’ in which the computer always sets the word and you (the human player) has to guess the word - but in this case there is a ‘twist’ – the computer can cheat – it has access to a dictionary and is able to change the chosen word on the fly during the game so as to avoid matches proposed by the human player trying to guess the word.
